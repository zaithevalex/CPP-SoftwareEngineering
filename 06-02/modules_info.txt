Module Organization with Partitions:

Modules can be split into partitions to organize code internally while exposing a single module name to consumers.

Format:
export module Name:PartitionName;

Types of Partitions:
1. Module Interface Partition:
   'export module rational:math;'
   Contributes to the external interface of the module. Must be exported by the primary module interface ('export import :math;').

2. Module Implementation Partition:
   'module rational:details;'
   Does not contribute to the external interface. Used for internal implementation splitting.

Benefits:
- Compilation speed: Changing one partition implementation only recompiles that partition.
- Logical separation: Grouping related functionality (e.g., math, io, utils).
- Encapsulation: Internal partitions are hidden from module users.

In this task, we used a simple Primary Interface Unit + Implementation Unit structure, which is the baseline. Partitions would be useful if Rational had many complex sub-components.
